          <p>The Moss Works is the newest little shop in adorable downtown Gresham. House plants, botanical troubleshooting, and accessories. But that's not all, there's a little of everything. New, vintage, kitch, reused, repurposed, and pro-crafted. Things to make your space a lovely place.</p>
           <p>We believe in growing plants, community, and spreading the little bit of knowledge it takes for anyone to be a green thumb at home. Honestly, life is too short, love where you live. Especially during these crazy times, when we're spending more time at home with our green, quarantine buddies, our plants!</p>
